1- When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

* A remote repository will be when it's work group, either my team or public.



2- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with remote repository?

* Because Git does not know what I need to pull exactly.



3- Describe the differences between forks, clones, & branches. when you use one instead of onther? 

* I use Froks when to use a project in GitHub with saving Author rights, & clones when I'd like to import any project to local, & branches when I'd like to test a feature that I'm not sure if it is better, or create new UI language .. etc.
