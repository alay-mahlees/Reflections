1- When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

* A remote repository will be when it's work group, either my team or public.



2- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with remote repository?

* Because Git does not know what I need to pull exactly.



3- Describe the differences between forks, clones, & branches. when you use one instead of onther? 

* I use Froks when to use a project in GitHub with saving Author rights, & clones when I'd like to import any project to local, & branches when I'd like to test a feature that I'm not sure if it is better, or create new UI language .. etc.



4- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of remote strored locally?

* I can add more commits on master branch till using git fetch & git merge or git pull to update the stored with the remote versions.



5- How would you collaborate without using git or github? what would be easier, and what would be harder?

*- It was by flash memory ... nothing else.
